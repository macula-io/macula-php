## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-11

### Breaking

- A provider serving with `Session::serveWaitForCallGated()` accepts a token
  only from the caller its audience names: that caller's 32-byte node id as
  lowercase hex, `bin2hex($caller->nodeId())`. Mint a token with
  `Ucan::create()` for the identity that will present it (macula-go v0.8.0).
- `Session::serveWaitForCall()` and `serveWaitForCallGated()` answer only
  CALLs signed by the caller they name; any other CALL gets no reply and never
  reaches PHP (macula-go v0.8.0).

### Changed

- macula-go v0.7.1 to v0.8.2.
- Direct dial treats every advertisement that verifies as a candidate.
  `resolveDirect()` and `resolveDirectWithCertChain()` ask the DHT again until
  one's station endpoint resolves or `$timeoutMs` passes. `callDirect()`,
  `callDirectWithUcan()` and `callDirectWithCertChain()` move on to the next
  candidate when a dial fails, and `getDirect()` when a fetch fails, within
  their `$timeoutMs`. When every candidate fails before the request is sent,
  the most recent candidate's failure is reported.
- `putDirect()`'s `$timeoutMs` bounds the station endpoint lookup as well as
  the dial.
- The gated examples mint each token for the identity that presents it, and
  `examples/13_direct_dial_ucan_gated_call.php` also shows a token minted for
  another caller being refused.

### Added

- `$timeoutMs` on `Session::resolveDirect()` and
  `resolveDirectWithCertChain()`, 10000 by default.
